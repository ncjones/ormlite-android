This fork of ormlite-android provides experimental support for query cancellation.

This package provides the Android specific functionality.  You will also need to download
the ormlite-core package as well.  Users that are connecting to SQL databases via JDBC
connections should download the ormlite-jdbc package instead of this Android one.

For more information, see the online documentation on the home page:
